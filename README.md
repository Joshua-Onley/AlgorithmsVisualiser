**Overview**

This project is a webapp that contains several animations of common algorithms used in computer science

**Features**

The webapp currently contains animations for the following algorithms:

* Bubble Sort
* Linear Search
* Binary Search
* Interpolation Search
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search

**Landing Page**

The landing page is a long list of algorithms divided into separate subgroups e.g. sorting algorithms, graph algorithms etc. When one of the algorithm links is clicked the user is 
taken to the relevant page containing the algorithm visualiser component and other information about the algorithm e.g. time/space complexities.
